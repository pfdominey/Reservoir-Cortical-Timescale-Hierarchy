This contains structured reservoirs that have been modifies so that here is a gradient of input, with strong input to low neourons, linerarly reducing to no input to high neurons.
This should produce more input driven similarity
the W matrices are identical for all reservoirs
the W_in matrices vary by 5%
so the reservoirs should be more similar
